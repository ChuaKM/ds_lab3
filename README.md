# ds_lab_3

Program computes the determinant of an nxn matrix, this time using a linked list structure. 

Similar to lab 2,
- Iterate through an input file, checking the validity of its components
- Create our Linked List ADT to manipulate the input matrix
- Calculating the cofactor and determinant of each input matrix
- Writing the results to an output file in a cogent format
